# Sabber_Work_2019F
For my Master's Thesis, I will be conducting research using Hearthone to dedect teachable moments. Because Hearthstone isn't open source, we are using an open source software developed by HearthSim called SabberStone (link below). This repository has an AI built in which will play a full game of Hearthstone against another AI, and output very detailed logs about the final decisions it makes. We can utilize these logs in order to investigate the high-level decisions made by each player in a study to determine which of these turns (moments) are in fact teachable (or not). 

## TODO

- [ ] Retrieve relevant turn information per player
- [ ] Create a train / test data set of games
- [ ] Build models to predict which turns are "teachable"
- [ ] Create some plots / tables
- [ ] Type up Thesis document first draft (on going)
